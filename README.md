## Limitations

The app follows the project requirements as stated in this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2849/view).

Therefore, following elements of a real-world app are not implemented:

- input validation of input fields
- dependency injection, required instances are just created on the fly when needed
- data persistance using a repository/DAO implementation
- user account handling, login data is not checked
- unittests and UI tests
- UI animations
